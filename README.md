## Half-Ride

Half-Ride is an Android application developed as my first project in app development. Inspired by the idea of facilitating commute partnerships among students, this app enables users to find potential commute partners from the same college or institution. The concept stemmed from my personal experience of meeting my girlfriend through a similar arrangement, which drove me to create this application. While the current version lacks robust design and security measures, I aim to improve upon these aspects in future updates.

### About

This project was initiated as part of a college Project Based Learning (PBL) endeavor. Despite having no prior experience with Java, I embarked on this journey by following simple tutorials and learning from various applications. It took approximately three months to develop the initial version of Half-Ride, with 99% of the code being written solely by me.

### Key Features

- **Google Account Integration:** Users can create profiles using their Google accounts, ensuring seamless authentication.
- **Profile Browsing:** Explore profiles of other users within the application.
- **Profile Customization:** Users have the ability to edit their profile details and add a personalized description.

### Planned Features

- **Private Pings:** Currently, ping notifications are displayed to all users. Future updates will limit notifications to the intended recipient.
- **Location Selection:** Integration of Google Maps for selecting commute areas or locations.
- **Filtered Profile Display:** Implement filters on the dashboard to display profiles based on organization and location.
- **In-App Messaging:** Enable communication between users through a built-in chat feature.

### Note

While Half-Ride serves its basic purpose of connecting potential commute partners, it's a work in progress. The focus is on enhancing user experience, security, and adding additional features to make commuting more convenient for college students.
